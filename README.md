# Scientific Calculator
## Description
The Scientific Calculator is a versatile command-line application that performs a variety of mathematical operations. It supports basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific functions. This calculator is designed to handle calculations involving trigonometric, logarithmic, and other mathematical functions.

## Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^)
- Advanced Mathematical Functions:

- Square Root (sqrt)
- Logarithm (log)
- Sine (sin)
- Cosine (cos)
- Tangent (tan)
- Arcsine (asin)
- Arccosine (acos)
- Arctangent (atan)
- ### Angle Conversion:

- Convert Degrees to Radians (deg2rad)
- Convert Radians to Degrees (rad2deg)

## Usage
Compile the Code:
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler and build tools installed. Navigate to your project directory and compile the code using the following command:
g++ -o scientific_calculator calculator.cpp

Replace calculator.cpp with the name of your source file if different.

Run the Calculator:
Execute the compiled program from the command line:
./scientific_calculator

Select an Operation:
Follow the on-screen menu to choose the desired operation and provide the required input values.

Here the available inputs:
- Select operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exponentiation (^)
6. Square Root (sqrt)
7. Logarithm (log)
8. Sine (sin)
9. Cosine (cos)
10. Tangent (tan)
11. Arcsine (asin)
12. Arccosine (acos)
13. Arctangent (atan)
14. Convert Degrees to Radians (deg2rad)
15. Convert Radians to Degrees (rad2deg)
Enter your choice: 5
Enter two operands: 2 3
2 ^ 3 = 8
